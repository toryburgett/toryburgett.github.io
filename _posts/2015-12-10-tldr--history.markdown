description: This single-page microblogging app compiles "TL;DR" (too long; didn't read) summaries of historical events - the funnier the better! Users can view events and their summaries added by others, and add their own. A user can also tweet out their favorite summaries and the tweet will mention the twitter handle of the app creators ("@TLDRhistory").
tagline: Short, funny and historically accurate
