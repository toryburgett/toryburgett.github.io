description: Where?Wolf is a quiz app that tests visitorâ€™s knowledge about wolves and where they are located in mythology and literature. I love puns, and the idea to make this site came from a conversation that began with the discussion of werewolves and evolved into a discussion of where wolves are found. I created the app in the MEAN stack using the Materialize framework and uploaded it to Heroku using MongoLabs.
tagline: Quizzes about the location of wolves. Howl you do?
